# FashionMNIST-CNN-Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

=>Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, classified into 10 categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

=>Model Architecture
The CNN model includes:
- Convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction
- Fully connected layers for classification
- Output layer with 10 units for the 10 fashion categories

=>Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FashionMNIST-CNN-Classifier.git
   cd FashionMNIST-CNN-Classifier

2.Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Usage
To train the model:
python train.py

4.To evaluate the model on the test set:
python evaluate.py

=>Results
The model achieves around X% accuracy on the test data.
